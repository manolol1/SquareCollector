# SquareCollector

**SquareCollector is a little arcade game made with libGDX where the goal is to collect as many falling squares as possible.**

## Running Instructions

### Java Executable (any Desktop OS, JVM required)

For this method, a Java Runtime needs to be installed.

1. Download the latest .jar file from the release tab.
2. Run the .jar file with Java. Sometimes, this can be done by double-clicking the file.
   If that doesn't work, you probably need to execute it by running `java -jar SquareCollector_Version.jar` in a terminal.


### APK File (Android)

1. Download the latest .apk file from the release tab. This file must be placed somewhere on your Android device. I recommend the Downloads folder.
2. Install the apk using a file browser. **Google Play Protect might block the installation. You need to tap on "more details" and then on "install anyway".**

### Native Linux Executable

This executable doesn't require installing any Java Runtime. All the necessary parts are included in the file.

1. Download the latest native_linux file from the release tab.
2. You most likely need to add executing permissions to the file. On most distributions this can be done by running `sudo chmod +x Exact_File_Name`.
3. Run the file by double clicking it. If that doesn't work, you can also run it in a terminal with the following command: `./Exact_File_Name`
